## CS200 - Role Analysis Report


Libre Office, a project originally from **The Document Foundation**, is a free and open source software that enables
users to perform office tasks such as write and edit documents, create spreadsheets and more. It supports many different file formats such as: 

- Compatible with Microsoft Office documents such as MicrosoftÂ® Word (.doc, .docx), Excel (.xls, .xlsx), PowerPoint (.ppt, .pptx) and Publisher. 
- Native support for a modern and open standard, the Open Document Format (ODF)

> On a daily basis, the LibreOffice project works through teams of contributors that coordinate the various tasks of development, localization, design, promotion, documentation, testing and expanding LibreOffice. (From https://www.libreoffice.org/)

### The Document Foundation (Governance)

Given that LibreOffice is a free and open source software, when talking about the different roles in the company, it is important to also talk about their governance. As mentioned prior, they are a project originally from The Document Foundation, which itself is also managed by several entities:

- The Board of Directors (or "BoD"): judicial and extrajudicial representatives
- The Membership Committee (or "MC"): oversees elections of BoD. Manage and oversee membership applications and renewals
- The Board of Trustees (or "Members"): active contributers to the project

The importance of their governance is that given its nature of being open-source, but in reality, LibreOffice is run by both the community and the different bodies that compose the Document Foundation. 

#### Members

Anyone can join the TDF and become a member. You can find the entire list of all approved members that are part of the TDF and contribute to the LibreOffice project on their website: https://www.documentfoundation.org/governance/members/. From different parts of the world, the members of the TDF all contribute their precious time, in combination of their hard-working effort and their vast knowledge in different parts of the tech field, to develop and assist the multiple projects of the TDF. 

#### Engineering Steering Committe

The Engineering Steering Committe, also known as the "ESC", is one of the first pillars of LibreOffice, but it is not itself part of the three bodies such as the BoD, MC and Members that compose the Document Foundation. Summarized, the ESC is the group within LibreOffice that consists of many engineers with numerous and diverse backgrounds, all with the task of providing technological advice and strategizing on specific matters in order to achieve numerous end goals to better the different projects carried out by the TDF and/or LibreOffice.

#### Advisory Board

Inside of LibreOffice, there exists also an advisory board with a forum for different organizations to provide financial or other means of support (like technical proposals and strategic technical advice). All of these logistics and pre-determinations are lead by the BoD. It is also possible to meet with the BoD, and these members of their advisory board also provide help to the project, or tasks related to the project. Some of the memebrs that are part of the Advisory Board include: **Gnome, Google, SPI, FSF, Kopano b.v., allotropia software GmbH, Adfinis SyGroup, RedHat, etc.**
