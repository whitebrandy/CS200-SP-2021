## General Overview
GNOME (originally an acronym for GNU Network Object Model Environment) is a free and open-source desktop environment for Unix-like operating systems. GNOME is developed by The GNOME Project, which is composed of both volunteers and paid contributors, the largest corporate contributor being Red Hat.

## About
- Led by non-profit GNOME Foundation
- Part of Free Software
- Work with other free projects to create high quality solutions that span entire software stack
- Development infrastructure and communication channels are public
- Code can be freely downloaded, modified, and shared with others
- Source code released publicly 
- All contributors have the same rights
- Software is translated into over 80 languages so people from all over the world can contribute
- Many GNOME contributors develop code, smash bugs, write documentation, and help users
- GNOME Technologies: https://www.gnome.org/technologies/  
- Free Open Source desktop environment for Unix-like Operating systems 


## GNOME Workflow

GNOME stands for GNU Network Object Model Environment) is a graphical user interface (GUI) and set of computer desktop applications for users of the Linux computer operating system intended to make a Linux operating system easy to use for non-programmers and generally corresponds to the Windows desktop interface and its most common set of applications.
- Users can choose whether the desktop appears to look like Windows 98 or Mac OS
- Includes a word processor, a spreadsheet program, a database manager, a presentation developer, a web browser, and an email program
- Derived from long-running volunteer effort under auspices of Free Software Foundation
- Composed by group of more than 500 different contributors, distributed across the world
- Founded by Richard Stallman
- Believe that software source code should always be public and open to change so that it can continuously be improved by others
- Comes with an object request broker (ORB) supporting the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) so that GNOME programs and programs from other operating system platforms in a network will be able to interoperate
- Includes a widget library that programmers can use to develop applications that use the GNOME user interface
- Divided into dozens of modules from libraries such as GUI, CORBA, XML, etc to core applications such as email client, graphical editor, word processor, spreadsheet, etc
Designed to be easy to use and customizable (kind of tailored for both mobile and desktops)
- Is not a lightweight desktop environment - so cannot install on older computers or systems with less than 4 Gigs of RAM
- Some major distros using GNOME are Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, and Ubuntu
- Pros: Modern and touch-friendly UI, can extend functionalities through GNOME Shell Extensions, Customizable
- Cons: Not suitable for older computers, not tailored for a Windows User

## Gnome 3 Usage
- Released in 2011
- Uses GNOME Shell (unlike Gnome 1 and 2), a more abstract metaphor where switching between different tasks and virtual desktops takes place in a separate area called "Overview".
- Notable criticism of its move away from the traditional menu bar and taskbar by the GNU and Linux community.

## Features
Activities Overview: Overview window appears with access to favorite applications, the search tool, virtual desktops, and the Dash

Dash: Dash contains launchers for those applications that are assigned as favorites.
Application Menus: menus aren't associated with individual application windows. This behavior is similar to macOS.

Search: Integrates many “search providers” that will provide entry to different apps. Acts as a unified entry for all searches and displays the desired contents will show up.

Dynamic Workspace: Drag and drop the window into a new workspace. Ctrl-Alt-Up/Down can help me quickly switch to another workspace. Ctrl-Shift-Alt-Up/Down can quickly move the current window to a different workspace.

Customizable Gnome Shell: Able to customize gnome-shell from top to bottom, changing every bit to your comfort.
