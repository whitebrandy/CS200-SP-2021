# Addition to Gnome Contribution Write-Up (Group 1)

Assignment Outline: Contributors are the key to the success of an open source project; be it developers, testers, documentors etc. With that in mind, we would encourage everybody to modify their responses and add a small section on various contributory roles. Once you have made some changes, you can do a regular of your repository and it will reflect in the existing pull request. For all projects mentioned in the assignment, we are posting links to pages (as hints) that document various roles to get you started.

Gnome is part of Free Software, meaning that code can be freely downloaded, modified, and shared with others. Gnome was created on the belief that software source code should always be public and open to change so that it can continuously be improved upon. Under this mindset, Gnome is maintained by over 500 different contributors from all over the world, many of whom are volunteers. While these contributors develop code, smash bugs, write documentation, and help users, the Gnome Foundation provides resources and infrastructure and acts as the official face of the organization beyond the digital system. 

Anyone, regardless of the language they speak or their physical abilities—including level of coding experience—may become a contributor. There are no requirements to start a project or development on Gnome—however, a basic knowledge in object oriented programming and git may be helpful. Contributors may choose to work with any of the many teams within Gnome, with topics ranging from accessibility, making Gnome accessible to anyone regardless of skill or abilities; accounts, managing access to Gnome development systems; moderators, organizing the Gnome mailing lists; to translation, translating the Gnome user interfaces and documentations into different languages. 

Two of the many ways to contribute to the Gnome Free Software include helping translate the Gnome user interface to different languages—bringing accessibility to the rest of the world—and writing documentation—helping to build and advance the free and open source community:
Gnome has been translated to over 80 languages with the help of volunteers and contributors. Anyone interested in joining Gnome’s Translation Project to continue to help improve existing translations or start new ones (or even to just get to know more about the Project) should join the Translation Project’s mailing list (using the following link: https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-i18n/) to ask questions, stay up to date with what other members are working on, and engage with the rest of the team. 
Within the Translation Project, there are three main roles: translators, reviewers, and committers. 
(PO files are files that contain the actual translations and POt files are the template files for PO files)
Translators are responsible for translating Gnome to specific languages (he/she may add themselves to any existing translation team or create a new team). They may also comment on specific PO file translations, reserve it for translations, or suggest new translations by uploading a new PO file (which would then be reviewed by other team members)
Reviewers are a subcategory of translator in which they are assigned to review newly suggested translations. They have access to all actions available to translators with the addition of certain reviewing tasks (such as reviewing POT files for consistency and spelling errors and performing general proofreading and quality control checks for consistency in translations) 
Committers are assigned the role of making changes to the Gnome translations that will be released (if the translations are accepted, otherwise it will remain on the interface as an attached PO file). Committers have access to all actions of translators and reviewers with the addition of committing PO files and archiving discussion for new suggestions.  
To start translating and reporting errors, individuals should:
Create an account on the Gnome translation collaboration webtool (through the following link: https://l10n.gnome.org/register/) and activate it by clicking on the email sent to him/her (Should be listed under “[DL]Account activation” or something similar)
Join the language team that he/she is interested in working with using the dropdown menu provided
Edit the profile page and provide some personal (including contact) information so that the team may be able to communicate with the him/her
From the profile page, he/she may click on the “Team Membership” list which outlines who is coordinating the team and a list of bugs assigned to the team (as well as the status of the current translations being performed by the members within the team, along with their roles)
On the team’s main page will also be a list of “Releases” and translation statistics for each one. For each section, he/she may select to translate the application user interface or documentation (it is recommended to start with the user interface and continue with the documentation)
For each application, there should be a translation percentage and status:
No status means the package is waiting to be translated or existing translations need to be improved upon
Translating means that someone has express the interest in translating this application and has reserved the application in order to avoid multiple people working on the same translation at the same time
Translated means that the translator has finished translating and is now waiting for the changes to be reviewed and committed
To review means that the translator has requested for someone to check his/her translation
Proofreading means the translations were done by one of the translators and is not being reviewed by another member of the team
To commit means that the reviewer has checked and corrected the translations and the changes are now ready to be committed and made available to all users
Once he/she has found a translation to work on, he/she should find it on Gnome Development and reserve the translation of the application (leaving a comment to let the rest of the team know his/her plans for the translation, for example time needed for translation). If there was a previous translation, he/she should download the translation file (a PO file) and work on that or if there was no previous translation, he/she should download a POT file and change it to create a PO file (renaming the file extension to .po and may ask other translators to help with setting up initial PO file)
Open the PO file in a translation editor (one that supports the PO file format) and translate the file before uploading it back on the Gnome translation website
To get started on the Documentation Team, individuals should first join the team on Gnome’s IRC (outlined by the following link: irc.gnome.org — the team is usually on #docs) to start engaging with the rest of the members and ask any questions. After that, he/she may pick an existing application from a list of tasks to work on, such as issues including Desktop Help and generic bugs, listed on GitLab (or he/she can find an issue on his/her own to work on). When he/she has chosen a project to work on, he/she should clone the git repository of the project and edit/make changes to the documentation. Submit a merge request after making changes to have the changes reviewed and possibly submitted as changes to current documentations (it is okay if first contributions are asked to be improved many times, it is quite normal and expected). An additional perk to working with the Documentation Team is that the Documentation Team only maintains documentation for the current release of any particular technological device so tasks may include testing the latest and greatest applications, which is very rarely provided by distributions!

There are many more ways, other than joining the Translation Team or Documentation Team, to get involved with Gnome such as joining the Coding Team and helping out with given tasks or joining the Engagement Team and help the organization through marketing, user outreach, event organization, and websites. Gnome is free and open to people from all levels and backgrounds so it is a great way to get involved with software!
